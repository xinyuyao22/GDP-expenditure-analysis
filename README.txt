The files used to create the G20 Spending website use a combination of Bootstrap, jQuery, and Google Charts API. Data files were sourced from the World Bank and the OECD and can be found in their respective folder. A formatted compilation of the data for simple copy and paste into the script section of each page is also included in the data folder. Copy of reference images are also included in the code folder. 

All images and music were created by Nick Harbeck.
